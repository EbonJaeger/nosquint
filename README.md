# Description
This is a maintained fork of the NoSquint FireFox extension by @jtackaberry. This project going forward targets the Pale Moon web browser instead of FireFox.

__Make any site easy to see, at any resolution!__

Having a hard time reading on the web? Is that website with the ridiculously small font and hot-pink-on-slightly-darker-hot-pink text raising your blood pressure?

NoSquint allows you to change the zoom of all, or just certain, webpages. That way, all of the sites that you visit can be made easy to read, with little hassle.

# Features
* Change the text-only and full-page (both text and images) zoom levels for all websites
* Change the background and foreground color for regular text
* Change the background and foreground color for both visited and unvisited links, seperately
* Disable background images on websites
* Remembers your zoom levels and color settings per site, automatically applying them when you return.
* Disagree with what NoSquint calls a site? A powerful exceptions mechanism lets you split up or group together sites with URL patterns.

All of this can be done both globally for all sites, and/or for individual websites.

# Credits
* @jtackaberry for all of the original work
* @Gnat008 for updating and maintaining the project for Pale Moon
